The following topics are covered in this repository:

1. [Conditional Statements](01_conditional_statements)
2. [Loops](02_loops)
3. [Patterns](03_patterns)
4. [Bitwise Operations](04_bitwise_operations)
5. [Number System](05_number_system)
6. [Match Case](06_match_case)
7. [Functions](07_functions)
8. [Array Algorithms](08_array_algorithms)
9. [Array Questions](09_array_questions)
10. [Binary Search Questions](10_binary_search_questions)
11. [Character String Questions](11_char_string_questions)
12. [Matrix Questions](12_matrix_questions)
13. [Pointers](13_pointers)
14. [Dynamic Memory](14_dynamic_memory)
15. [Recursion](15_recursion)
16. [Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](16_oops)
17. [Linked List](17_linked_list)

22. [Heaps](22_heaps)
23. [Hashmaps](23_hashmaps)
24. [Trie](24_trie)
25. [Backtracking](25_backtracking)
26. [Graphs](26_graphs)

Each topic folder contains Python code files (*.py) that demonstrate the implementation of algorithms or solutions to specific problems related to the corresponding DSA topic.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/DataRohit/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms.git`


2. Navigate to the desired topic folder to explore the code examples or problem solutions.
